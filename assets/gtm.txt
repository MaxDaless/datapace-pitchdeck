Go-to-Market Strategy: A Focused Beachhead
Our strategy is to win a specific, high-value market first, then expand.

1. Land (The Beachhead):

Target Persona:

Tech Leads & Senior Engineers at high-growth (Series B-D) companies, typically managing 5+ PostgreSQL instances and lacking dedicated in-house DBAs.

Target Verticals: We will focus on sectors where database latency is a C-level concern:

E-commerce

FinTech

B2B SaaS

Technical Wedge:

PostgreSQL Performance. We will be the undisputed best AI-driven solution for this stack, leveraging our PoC and deep understanding.

Motion:

Win developer trust via a powerful free tier, intuitive product-led onboarding, and targeted technical content/community engagement to drive bottoms-up adoption.

2. Expand:

Once embedded, we expand across the organization and upmarket by:

Introducing enterprise features (e.g., advanced security controls, SSO for larger teams).

Offering FinOps dashboards for CFOs, directly linking engineering effort to financial impact.

Adding support for other critical data stores (Snowflake, MySQL, MongoDB) to serve the full database footprint.

Driving increased DPU consumption as customers scale their usage and analytical needs.
